# Sarah's prework-study-guide

## Description

This study guide serves as a tool, to provide a library of study notes from the Bootcamp web development course via University of Oregon. When thoroughly populated, it will serve as an ongoing reference for this specific course, as well as a future reference for web development programs during my future coding career. It also served as a learning tool on how to build a web site, including creating and solving potential errors and bugs.
